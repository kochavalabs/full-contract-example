# Full Contract Example

The repo is meant to be a quick tutorial that will familiarize users with
contract development. It's meant to give an overview of how to write, deploy and
update a contract. We will also cover the Mazzaroth CLI tools, XDR code
generation, writing unit tests and interacting with a mazzaroth node from the
browser.
